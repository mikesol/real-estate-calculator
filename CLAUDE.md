# Claude Instruction File

## Project Overview
This repository contains PDF documents related to sustainable real estate, focusing on ESG criteria, regulatory frameworks (EU Taxonomy, SFDR), and calculation methodologies for sustainable property investments.

## Commands
- Currently, this is a document repository with no build/lint/test commands

## Sustainable Real Estate Calculation Rules

### Fund Structure Handling
- Direct assets: 100% inclusion when meeting sustainability criteria
- SCIs (owned at 100%): Full look-through approach
- Controlled participations (>50%): Full consolidation 
- Uncontrolled participations (20-50%): Proportional calculation based on ownership percentage
- Minority stakes (<20%): Based on available data or sectoral averages
- PE fund participations: Use best-effort estimations when specific data unavailable

### Sustainability Criteria (Based on Rothschild/ASPIM Guidelines)
- Assets must satisfy three conditions to qualify as sustainable:
  1. Positive contribution to environmental/social objective (min score â‰¥ 2.5/10 on UN SDGs)
  2. Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) compliance
  3. Good governance practices (min score of 8/20 internal ESG rating or 4/10 MSCI)

### Real Estate Specific Thresholds
- Buildings must meet one of these criteria:
  1. EPC class A OR in top 15% of national/regional building stock (for pre-2020 buildings)
  2. NZEB -10% (for post-2020 buildings)
  3. 30% reduction in primary energy demand/GHG compared to initial performance

## Document Standards
- Prefer searchable PDFs
- Maintain document integrity
- Create separate markdown files for analyses

## Special Instructions
- Aim for simplicity in calculation methodology similar to Rothschild approach
- Ensure compliance with AMF and ASPIM guidelines
- Follow SFDR Article 8/9 classifications and EU Taxonomy alignment
